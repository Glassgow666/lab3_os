# Lab3OS LAST IN FIRST OUT(LIFO)
## DESCRIPTION
## About LIFO

**LIFO** is an abbreviation for **last in, first out**. It is a method for handling data structures where the **first element** is processed last and the **last element** is processed first.

**Real life example:**

In this example, following things are to be considered:

- There is a bucket which holds balls.

- Different types of balls are entered in the bucket.

- The ball to enter the bucket last, will be taken out first.

- The ball entering the bucket next to last will be taken out after the ball above it (the newer one).

- In this way, the ball entering the bucket first will leave the bucket last.

- Therefore, the Last ball (Blue) to enter the bucket gets removed first and the First ball (Red) to enter the bucket gets removed last.


**This is known as Last-In-First-Out approach or LIFO.**


**Where is LIFO used:**

1) **Data Structures** –

Certain data structures like Stacks and other variants of Stacks uses LIFO approach for processing data.


2) **Extracting latest information** –

Sometimes computers use LIFO when data is extracted from an array or data buffer. When it is required to get the most recent information entered, the LIFO approach is used.
